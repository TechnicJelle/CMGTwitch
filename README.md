# CMGTwitch

An app concept that lets you easily (re)watch Saxion CMGT lectures

### [technicjelle.com/CMGTwitch](https://technicjelle.com/CMGTwitch/)

#### Assignment Requirements:

A system where students find their current and past modules in their education trajectory. In these modules, they should be able to find past, current and upcoming lectures, and join them if possible. The student should be able to find specific topics covered in recorded lectures so they can skip to what they are looking for. For live lectures, there should be a built-in chat function that encourages constructive discussions rather than spam, and allows for good interaction between lecturer/presenter and students/audience.
